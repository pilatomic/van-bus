This page describes the format of the log currently produced by the vanmon series of PIC programs. The SVN bus\_captures directory contains files with the extention .rt3 in this format.

Examples:

4D4 RAT - 8FC RA- 820D1A0D82 A

Format:

  * IDEN
  * Flags
    * R/W - Read or Write
    * A - Acknowledge request
    * T - Remote Trasmission Request (RTR)
  * Data
  * Acknowledge received



&lt;hr&gt;



The SVN bus\_captures direcory also contains capture logs with a .van file extention. These logs are in a raw format representing exactly what is read from the VAN bus. These files are generated by auldy's interface hardware.


Examples:

9C4C0080D4E2N

Format
  * 9C4 - IDEN
  * C - Flags 1100 (Acknowledge request and Write)
  * 0080 - Data portion
  * D4E2 - CRC15
  * N - Acknowledge not received


This particular packet is broadcast by the COM2000 on the steering wheel containing status of the radio remote for the head unit. The headunit was not installed in my car when I captured this packet hence the packet was not acknowledged.


The same packet in RT3 log format would look like this
9C4 WA- 0080 A
